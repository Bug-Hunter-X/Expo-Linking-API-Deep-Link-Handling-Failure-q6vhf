# Expo Linking API Deep Link Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Expo's `Linking` API to handle deep links. The problem lies in the unreliable nature of the API, leading to situations where the app fails to register or respond to deep links properly. This can result in deep links not opening the app or triggering the intended actions.  The lack of detailed error messages makes debugging challenging.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the app (using Expo Go or EAS Build).
3. Attempt to open a deep link (the exact URL scheme will be specified in the `deepLinkBug.js` file).  Observe that the app might not open or behave as expected.
4. Refer to `deepLinkSolution.js` for potential solutions and best practices.

## Potential Solutions

- Ensure the app is correctly configured to handle the desired URL scheme.
- Properly handle potential errors using try-catch blocks or promises.
- Add more robust logging for debugging purposes.
- Consider using a third-party library for more reliable deep link handling.
